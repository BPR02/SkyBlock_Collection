(Upcoming...) Advancements will display a natural progression tree for SkyBlock.

### Dependencies
[Sky Void Worldgen](https://github.com/BluePsychoRanger/SkyBlock_Collection/blob/main/skyvoid_worldgen) must be installed alongside this data pack. If this is downloaded from the [Releases](https://github.com/BluePsychoRanger/SkyBlock_Collection/releases), it is prepackaged and doesn't require downloading both data packs.
