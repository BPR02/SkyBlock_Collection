# Starter Islands
The starter island data packs are used to create an island upon world load. These should be installed upon creating the world. If they are added after one of the worldgen data packs generates the world, an island will not generate. Only one of these should be installed at a time.

## [Standard SkyBlock](https://github.com/BluePsychoRanger/SkyBlock_Collection/blob/main/starter_islands/skyvoid_standard_skyblock)
The `skyvoid_standard_skyblock` data pack generates a standard skyblock island at the world spawn point upon initial world load. 

## [Vanilla One Block](https://github.com/BluePsychoRanger/SkyBlock_Collection/blob/main/starter_islands/skyvoid_vanilla_oneblock)
The `skyvoid_vanilla_oneblock` data pack will generate a single grass block in a snowy taiga biome upon initial world load.
