## Vanilla One Block
### Starter Island
A single grass block will generate in a Snowy Taiga biome at Y=-61. The calculations are intensive, so to prevent the game from crashing, some worlds will fail to generate the island.

### Dependencies
[Sky Void Worldgen](https://github.com/BluePsychoRanger/SkyBlock_Collection/blob/main/worldgen) must be installed alongside this data pack. 

### Credit
The idea to create this was inspired by [Pinu's Vanilla One Block series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66q2bgLwWLs).
