# SkyBlock Data Packs
This is a collection of data packs to generate and play SkyBlock

## Sky Void Worldgen
The `skyvoid_worldgen` data pack generates an infinite void world with properties akin to the original SkyBlock. For more information, view the [README](https://github.com/BluePsychoRanger/SkyBlock_Collection/blob/main/skyvoid_worldgen/README.md) in the data pack.

## Standard SkyBlock
The `skyvoid_standard_skyblock` data pack generates a standard skyblock island at the world spawn point upon initial world load. For more information, view the [README](https://github.com/BluePsychoRanger/SkyBlock_Collection/blob/main/skyvoid_standard_skyblock/README.md) in the data pack.

## Vanilla One Block
There will soon be a `skyvoid_oneblock` data pack that will generate a single grass block in a snowy taiga biome upon initial world load.

## BPRMode4
This is a WIP "modded" skyblock experience and should not be downloaded. It relies on [Gamemode 4](https://gm4.co) and custom mechanics.
