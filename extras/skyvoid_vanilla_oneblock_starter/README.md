## Vanilla One Block Starter
The `skyvoid_vanilla_oneblock_starter` data pack facilitates the initial grind at the beginning of [One Block](https://github.com/BluePsychoRanger/SkyBlock_Collection/blob/main/starter_islands/skyvoid_vanilla_oneblock). The following features will apply until a player obtains an iron shovel.

### Features
- All zombies will spawn with iron shovels, which will have a 80% chance of dropping with at least 25% durability left (63/250)
- Jumping will cause the player to gain the Hunger effect
- Players will be reduced to 4 hearts when starving (initial starving damage deals 6 hearts instead of half a heart of damage)

### Dependencies
[Vanilla One Block](https://github.com/BluePsychoRanger/SkyBlock_Collection/blob/main/starter_islands/skyvoid_vanilla_oneblock) must be installed alongside this data pack. 

### Credit
The idea to create this was inspired by [Pinu's Vanilla One Block series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66q2bgLwWLs).
