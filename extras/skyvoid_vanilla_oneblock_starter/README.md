## Vanilla One Block Starter
The `skyvoid_vanilla_oneblock_starter` data pack facilitates the initial grind at the beginning of [One Block](https://github.com/BluePsychoRanger/SkyBlock_Collection/blob/main/starter_islands/skyvoid_vanilla_oneblock). The following features will apply until a player obtains an iron shovel.

### Features
- Over 80% of hostile mobs that spawn will be zombies
- All zombies will spawn with iron shovels, which will have a 80% chance of dropping with at least 25% durability left (63/250)
- Jumping will cause the player to gain the Hunger effect (unless there's a zombie in the world)
- Players will be reduced to 4 hearts when starving (initial starving damage deals 6 hearts instead of half a heart of damage)
- Players will have full knockback resistance
- Daytime will be skipped (unless there's a zombie in the world)
- Once the shovel is obtained, it will continuously rain until 23 snow blocks are placed down

The idea to create this was inspired by [Pinu's Vanilla One Block series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66q2bgLwWLs).
