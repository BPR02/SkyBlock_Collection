# Extras
The extra data packs are custom packs that make more things possible or easier. Any of these can be installed alongside each other.

## [No End Ship](https://github.com/BluePsychoRanger/SkyBlock_Collection/blob/main/extras/skyvoid_no_end_ship)
The `skyvoid_no_end_ship` data pack disables the generation of the end ship blocks. If this is installed, only the shulkers and elytra item frame will generate in place of the full ship.

## [Vanilla One Block Starter](https://github.com/BluePsychoRanger/SkyBlock_Collection/blob/main/extras/skyvoid_vanilla_oneblock_starter)
The `skyvoid_vanilla_oneblock_starter` data pack will facilitate the start of [Vanilla One Block](https://github.com/BluePsychoRanger/SkyBlock_Collection/blob/main/starter_islands/skyvoid_vanilla_oneblock). 

## [BPRMode4](https://github.com/BluePsychoRanger/SkyBlock_Collection/blob/main/extras/bprmode4_core)
This is a WIP "modded" skyblock experience and should not be downloaded. It relies on [Gamemode 4](https://gm4.co) and custom mechanics.
