# Worldgen
The worldgen data packs are used to infinitely generate a void world. These should be installed upon creating the world. Only one of these should be installed at a time.

## [Default](https://github.com/BluePsychoRanger/SkyBlock_Collection/blob/main/worldgen/skyvoid_worldgen)
The `skyvoid_worldgen` data pack generates an infinite void world with properties akin to the original SkyBlock. 
## [Lava Pit under End Portal](https://github.com/BluePsychoRanger/SkyBlock_Collection/blob/main/worldgen/skyvoid_worldgen_full_lava)
The `skyvoid_worldgen_full_lava` data pack generates an infinite void world with properties akin to the original SkyBlock. Every end portal will have a 3x3 pit of lava beneath it. 
## [Single Lava under End Portal](https://github.com/BluePsychoRanger/SkyBlock_Collection/blob/main/worldgen/skyvoid_worldgen_single_lava)
The `skyvoid_worldgen_single_lava` data pack generates an infinite void world with properties akin to the original SkyBlock. Every end portal will have a single block of lava beneath it.
