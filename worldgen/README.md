# Worldgen
The worldgen data packs are used to infinitely generate a void world. These should be installed upon creating the world. Only one of these should be installed at a time.

All of these data packs will generate an infinite void world with properties akin to the [original SkyBlock](https://skyblock.net/). This means all structures (that matter) will generate with their bounding boxes at the same location as if the world with the same seed was generated with normal terrain. For most of the data packs, end portals and sculks sensors generate in the world to enter the end and obtain sculk.

## [Default](https://github.com/BluePsychoRanger/SkyBlock_Collection/blob/main/worldgen/skyvoid_worldgen)
The `skyvoid_worldgen` data pack will generate an end portal and sculk sensors around the world. Lava is unobtainable unless the player starts with lava or an alternate way to get lava is implemented.
## [Lava Pit under End Portal](https://github.com/BluePsychoRanger/SkyBlock_Collection/blob/main/worldgen/skyvoid_worldgen_full_lava)
The `skyvoid_worldgen_full_lava` data pack will generate a 3x3 pit of lava beneath end portals. 
## [Single Lava under End Portal](https://github.com/BluePsychoRanger/SkyBlock_Collection/blob/main/worldgen/skyvoid_worldgen_single_lava)
The `skyvoid_worldgen_single_lava` data pack will generate a single source of lava beneath end portals. 
## [Stronghold Portal Room](https://github.com/BluePsychoRanger/SkyBlock_Collection/blob/main/worldgen/skyvoid_worldgen_portal_room)
The `skyvoid_worldgen_portal_room` data pack generate the full stronghold portal room which has 15 lava and a silverfish spawner. 
## [Completely Empty](https://github.com/BluePsychoRanger/SkyBlock_Collection/blob/main/worldgen/skyvoid_worldgen_empty)
The `skyvoid_worldgen_empty` data pack generates an fully void world in which no blocks or entities will generate.
