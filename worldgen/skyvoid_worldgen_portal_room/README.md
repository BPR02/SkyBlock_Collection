## Sky Void Worldgen (Portal Room)
The `skyvoid_worldgen_portal_room` data pack generates an infinite void world with properties akin to the original SkyBlock. Strongholds will generate with the full portal room. 

### Structures
All structures that are important in SkyBlock will generate at the same coordinates with the same bounding boxes and entities as they would in a normal world with the same seed:
- **Ancient Cities** will generate sculk shriekers that can spawn wardens (location of shriekers won't match with a normal world)
- **Ocean Monuments** will generate with the same bounding box, but no elder guardians (guardians farms can be built as normal)
- **Pillager Outposts** will generate with the same bounding box with any allays that normally generate
- **Strongholds** will only generate the portal room with an end portal frame with some filled eyes (though it won't match with a normal world with the same seed), the lava pits containing 15 lava source blocks, and the silverfish spawner
- **Witch Huts** will generate with the same bounding box (witch farms can be built as normal)
- **Mansions** will generate any allays that would generate in a normal world
- **Nether Fortresses** will generate with the same bounding box
- **End Cities** will generate any shulkers or elytra item frames that normally generate

### The End Dimension
In the end dimension, the obsidian pillars and the exit end portal generate as normal. When a player goes through an end gateway, a small end island will still generate, but the rest of the outer end islands will not.
