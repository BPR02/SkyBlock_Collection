## Sky Void Worldgen (Empty)
The `skyvoid_worldgen` data pack generates an infinite void world with properties akin to the original SkyBlock. No blocks or entities will generate.

### Structures
All structures that are important in SkyBlock will generate at the same coordinates with the same bounding boxes and entities as they would in a normal world with the same seed:
- **Ancient Cities** will with generate the same bounding box
- **Ocean Monuments** will generate with the same bounding box, but no elder guardians (guardians farms can be built as normal)
- **Pillager Outposts** will generate with the same bounding box with any allays that normally generate
- **Strongholds** will not generate
- **Witch Huts** will generate with the same bounding box (witch farms can be built as normal)
- **Mansions** will not generate
- **Nether Fortresses** will generate with the same bounding box
- **End Cities** will not generate

### The End Dimension
In the end dimension, the the exit end portal generate as normal. When a player goes through an end gateway, a small end island will still generate, but the rest of the outer end islands will not. The obsidian pillars and end crystals do not generate when first entering the end, but will generate when respawning the dragon.
