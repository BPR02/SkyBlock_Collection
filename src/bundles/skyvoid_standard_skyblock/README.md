## Standard SkyBlock
This data pack generates a standard skyblock island at the world spawn point upon initial world load. A nether island is also created. 

The worldgen data pack infinitely generates a void world with properties akin to the [original SkyBlock](https://skyblock.net/). This means all structures (that matter) will generate with their bounding boxes at the same location as if the world with the same seed was generated with normal terrain. End portals and sculk sensors generate in the world to enter the end and obtain sculk.

### Starter Island
This island will generate with 54 dirt, 26 grass blocks, 1 bedrock (at world spawn), an oak tree, and a chest with an ice block and bucket of lava.

### Nether Island
The nether island will generate with 40 netherrack, 7 crimson nylium, 7 warped nylium, 2 soul sand, 2 nether wart, and 14 obsidian for the portal.

### Structures
Structures that are important in SkyBlock will generate at the same coordinates with the same bounding boxes and entities as they would in a normal world with the same seed:
- **Ancient Cities** will generate sculk shriekers that can spawn wardens (location of shriekers won't match with a normal world)
- **Ocean Monuments** will generate with the same bounding box, but no elder guardians (guardians farms can be built as normal)
- **Pillager Outposts** will generate with the same bounding box with any allays that normally generate
- **Strongholds** will only generate an entrance end portal with some filled eyes (though it won't match with a normal world with the same seed)
- **Witch Huts** will generate with the same bounding box (witch farms can be built as normal)
- **Mansions** will generate any allays that would generate in a normal world
- **Nether Fortresses** will generate with the same bounding box
- **End Cities** will generate any shulkers and ships that would generate in a normal world

### The End Dimension
In the end dimension, the obsidian pillars and the exit end portal generate as normal. When a player goes through an end gateway, a small end island will still generate, but the rest of the outer end islands will not.

## Unobtainable Items
Some items are unobtainable with just this simple world generation. I made an expansion pack that adds mechanics that allow all items, mobs, and advancements to be obtained. Download [Sky Void Additions](https://beta.smithed.dev/packs/TTYznbt8KOY4qbHgMsIl) to expand the possibilities.

## Other Void Worldgen Packs
My [SkyBlock Collection](https://github.com/BluePsychoRanger/SkyBlock_Collection) has additional options for how the void world generates. Most notably there are other presets that have the stronghold generate with the pit of lava beneath the end portal, or the entire portal room. There is also a preset that removes all blocks and entities, leaving only a biome map with structure bounding boxes.
