## SkyBlock Dirt Hardcore (HardBlock)
This data pack generates a classic skyblock island without a tree or chest (only dirt) at the bottom of the world in a Snowy Taiga biome (at Y=-64). This is similar to [Vanilla One Block](https://smithed.net/packs/vanilla_one_block), but is possible to play in hardcore mode. The world spawn point will be moved to the location of the island at Y=0, so mobs will be able to spawn on the island. The locator will fail if there isn't a snowy taiga within 2000 blocks, so some worlds will fail to generate the island.

The worldgen data pack infinitely generates a void world with properties akin to the [original SkyBlock](https://skyblock.net/). This means all structures (that matter) will generate with their bounding boxes, but no blocks. These structures will generate at the same location as if the world with the same seed was generated with normal terrain. The only blocks that generate apart from the starter islands are End portals and sculk sensors.

### Structures
Structure bounding boxes that are important in SkyBlock will generate at the same coordinates along with some entities as they would in a normal world with the same seed:
- **Ancient Cities** will generate the same bounding boxes and sculk shriekers that can spawn wardens (location of shriekers won't match with a normal world)
- **Ocean Monuments** will generate the same bounding box, but no elder guardians (guardians farms can be built as normal)
- **Pillager Outposts** will generate the same bounding box with any allays that normally generate
- **Strongholds** will only generate an entrance end portal with some filled eyes (though it won't match with a normal world with the same seed). Every end portal will have a single block of lava beneath it.
- **Witch Huts** will generate the same bounding box (witch farms can be built as normal)
- **Mansions** will generate any allays that would generate in a normal world
- **Nether Fortresses** will generate the same bounding box
- **Trial Chambers** will generate the same bounding box

### The End Dimension
In the end dimension will generate as normal.

## Unobtainable Items
Some items are unobtainable with just this simple world generation. I made an expansion pack that adds mechanics that allow all items, mobs, and advancements to be obtained. Download [Sky Void Additions](https://smithed.net/packs/skyvoid_additions) to expand the possibilities.

## Other Void Worldgen Packs
My [SkyBlock Collection](https://github.com/BluePsychoRanger/SkyBlock_Collection) has additional options for how the void world generates. Most notably there are other presets that have the stronghold generate with the pit of lava beneath the end portal, or the entire portal room. There is also a preset that removes all blocks and entities, leaving only a biome map with structure bounding boxes.
