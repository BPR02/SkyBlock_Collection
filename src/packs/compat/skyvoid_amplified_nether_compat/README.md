## SkyBlock Amplified Nether Compatibility Patch
This datapack adds compatibility between [Standard SkyBlock](https://smithed.net/packs/standard-skyblock) and [Amplified Nether](https://modrinth.com/datapack/amplified-nether). 

This pack requires both Amplified Nether and Standard SkyBlock. Make sure the compatibility pack loads after (i.e. above) both packs. The order of the other two doesn't matter.

![Installation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BluePsychoRanger/SkyBlock_Collection/main/images/skyvoid_amplified_nether.png)

When these three packs are installed, the nether will be extended to 384 blocks high, but will have no blocks. In SkyBlock this doesn't have a very noticeable change, but this pack is an option for those who want to build higher.
