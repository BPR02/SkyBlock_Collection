## SkyBlock Terralith Compatibility Patch
This datapack adds compatibility between [Standard SkyBlock](https://smithed.net/packs/standard-skyblock) and [Terralith](https://modrinth.com/datapack/terralith). 

This pack requires both Terralith and Standard SkyBlock. Make sure the compatibility pack loads after (i.e. above) both packs. The order of the other two doesn't matter.

![Installation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BluePsychoRanger/SkyBlock_Collection/main/images/skyvoid_terralith.png)

When these three packs are installed, the overworld will be pure void (i.e. no generated blocks) and contain the custom biomes and structure bounding boxes added by Terralith. The world will have structure bounding boxes in the exact locations as a world with only Terralith. Using this pack will also add compatibility for [Terratonic](https://modrinth.com/datapack/terratonic), but the only noticeable change in a skyblock world is a change to bounding box locations.
