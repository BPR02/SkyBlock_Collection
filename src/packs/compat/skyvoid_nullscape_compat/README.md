## SkyBlock Nullscape Compatibility Patch
This datapack adds compatibility between [Standard SkyBlock](https://smithed.net/packs/standard-skyblock) and [Nullscape](https://modrinth.com/datapack/nullscape). 

This pack requires both Nullscape and Standard SkyBlock. Make sure the compatibility pack loads after (i.e. above) both packs. The order of the other two doesn't matter.

![Installation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BPR02/SkyBlock_Collection/main/images/skyvoid_nullscape.png)

When these three packs are installed, the end will be extended to 384 blocks high and will contain the Nullscape custom biomes, but no blocks. Similar to Standard Skyblock, the exit end portal, obsidian pillars, return gateways, and end city ships will still generate.
