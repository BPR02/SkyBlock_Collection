# SkyBlock Sand Island
This data pack adds a floating sand island that generates near 0 0. The sand island is made up of 27 sand blocks, a cactus, and a chest containing useful items. This pack may work with other skyblock data packs, but it's recommended to use [Standard SkyBlock](https://smithed.net/packs/standard-skyblock) for best compatibility.

## Simpler SkyBlock Progression
The chest on the island contains the following items:
- 10 Obsidian
- 1 Sweet Berry
- 1 Glow Berry
- 1 Melon Slice
- 1 Pumpkin Seed
- 1 Sugar Cane
- 1 Cobweb
- 1 Cocoa Bean
- 1 Mycelium
- 1 Glow Lichen
- 1 Sunflower
- 1 Rose Bush
- 1 Lilac
- 1 Peony

Most of these items are unobtainable in normal skyblock, but become renewable after obtaining one of them. While some of these items are obtainable through other methods, this data pack lessens the grind needed to get them. For example, the method to get to the nether without the given 10 obsidian is normally quite long and tedious; it requires obtaining emeralds, waiting for wandering traders to spawn, and generating lava with dripstone.
