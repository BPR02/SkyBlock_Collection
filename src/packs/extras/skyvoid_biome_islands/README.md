# SkyBlock Biome Islands
This data pack adds extra islands to a skyblock world depending on the biome. [Standard SkyBlock](https://smithed.net/packs/standard-skyblock) is recommended when using the data pack.  

![Example Biome Islands](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BluePsychoRanger/SkyBlock_Collection/main/images/biome_islands.png)

Biome islands will generate 20 chunks away from each other on average, with a minimum of 8 chunks between each biome island. This makes biome islands somewhat sparse, but common enough to find each one in a single world.

## Affected Biomes
The following biomes can generate islands. Each biome was chosen to create a diverse set of islands that each added something not easily obtainable by other means.

### Overworld Surface
- Badlands (red sand, cacti, and terracotta)
- Birch Forest (birch wood)
- Cherry Grove (cherry wood and pink petals)
- Dark Forest (dark oak wood and most tall flowers)
- Desert (sand, cacti, wood camels)
- Ice Spikes (snow and packed ice)
- Jungle (jungle wood, cocoa beans, bamboo, and melons)
- Mangrove Swamp (mangrove wood, mud, and sugar cane)
- Mushroom Fields (mushrooms, mycelium, and mooshrooms)
- Savanna (acacia wood)
- Sunflower Plains (sunflowers and pumpkins)
- Taiga (spruce wood and sweet berries)

### Overworld Caves
- Deep Dark (sculk shriekers, catalysts, and sensors)
- Dripstone Caves (dripstone, tuff, and cobwebs)
- Lush Caves (clay, amethyst, moss, glow berries and dripleaves)

### The Nether
- Basalt Deltas (basalt and lava)
- Crimson Forest (crimson wood and nylium)
- Soul Sand Valley (soul soil and soul sand)
- Warped Forest (warped wood and nylium)

### The End
- End Highlands (chorus flowers)
