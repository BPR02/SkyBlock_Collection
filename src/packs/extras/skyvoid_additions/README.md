# Sky Void Additions
This data pack adds vanilla-like mechanics to the game which makes all items, mobs, and advancements obtainable in SkyBlock. Some mechanics require structure bounding boxes, so make sure your SkyBlock map or data pack generates those bounding boxes, such as [Standard SkyBlock](https://smithed.dev/packs/standard-skyblock).
